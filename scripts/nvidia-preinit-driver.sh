# TrueNAS PREINIT for the custom-driver sysext path.
#
# Two responsibilities, both must run before Docker starts:
#   1. Survive TrueNAS updates. /usr gets replaced on update, which wipes
#      our custom nvidia.raw and restores stock. Compare SHAs between live
#      and persistent backup; if they differ, restore the custom.
#   2. Detect kernel-version mismatch. TrueNAS updates often bump the
#      kernel; our bundled nvidia.ko targets a specific kernel and will
#      simply not load against a different one. Surface the mismatch
#      loudly in syslog with a pointer at the release page so the user
#      doesn't end up debugging "nvidia-smi reports no devices" via
#      strace.
#
# MIG service start is NOT handled here — install-mig-sysext.sh registers a
# separate PREINIT entry that runs `systemctl start nvidia-mig-setup.service`.
# That ordering doesn't matter: nvidia-mig-setup has a built-in wait for
# the driver to become responsive (not just for the nvidia-smi binary to
# appear), so the two PREINITs can fire in either order without coordination.
#
# Registered via midclt initshutdownscript by install-mig-sysext.sh --with-driver.
# Logs to both stdout (visible via journalctl -u <init-shutdown-script>)
# and syslog tagged `nvidia-preinit-driver` (journalctl -b -t nvidia-preinit-driver
# for boot-scoped filtering).
#
# Never exits non-zero — must not block boot. All errors are logged and
# the script continues. The kernel-mismatch and SHA-restore branches
# print clear remediation hints.

# ── Phase 2: kernel-version mismatch detection ────────────────────────────
# nvidia.ko is built against a specific kernel. After a TrueNAS update
# bumps the kernel, our bundled module silently won't load and the user
# is left with "nvidia-smi: NVIDIA-SMI couldn't find any device" with no
# obvious cause. Surface the mismatch with a clear pointer at the release
# page so the user knows what's needed (a new sysext built for the new
# kernel — coming from check-releases auto-bumps).
#
# Module loading is normally driven by udev when the GPU PCI device is
# probed — we don't insmod here. We only verify the file exists for the
# running kernel.
#
# Path-finding strategy: search anywhere under /usr/lib/modules/<kver>/
# rather than hard-coding the subdir. On TrueNAS the merged custom sysext
# lands nvidia.ko at .../video/nvidia.ko (not .../updates/dkms/nvidia.ko
# like the build-script staging would suggest — depmod / installer
# normalize the layout on merge). Also tolerant of compressed modules
# (nvidia.ko.zst / .xz / .gz) for future kernels.
